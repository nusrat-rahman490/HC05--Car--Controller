# ðŸ¤– Bluetooth Controlled Robot Car

A wireless robotic car built using Arduino Uno, controlled remotely via Bluetooth using an Android mobile app. The project uses an HC-05 Bluetooth module to receive commands and an L293D motor driver to control the movement of two gear motors. Ideal for learning embedded systems, motor control, and wireless communication.



## ðŸ”§ Components Used

- Arduino Uno
- HC-05 Bluetooth module
- L293D Motor Driver IC
- 2Ã— Gear Motors
- 2Ã— Wheels + 1 Support Wheel
- Breadboard
- Jumper Wires
- 9V or 12V Battery Pack



## ðŸ“± App Used

- **Bluetooth RC Controller** (available on Google Play Store)

## ðŸš€ How It Works

- The Bluetooth module receives commands from a mobile phone.
- The Arduino interprets these commands and drives the motors via the L293D motor driver.
- The car can move forward, backward, turn left, right, and stop based on button inputs from the app.
